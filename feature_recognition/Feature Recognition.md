# Feature Recognition

## Goal

Find points in an image that can be precisely and reliably found in other images.

We will detect features (feature points) in both images and match them together to find the corresponding points.

## Problems

### How can we detect the same points independently in both images?

We need a **repeatable detector**.

### How do we correlate feature points?

We need a **descriptor**.

## Applications of Feature Recognition

3D construction, motion tracking, object recognition, robot navigation ...
