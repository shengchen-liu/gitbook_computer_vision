# Introduction to Features

## Characteristics of good features

- **Repeatability / Precision**

  The same feature can be found in several images despite geometric and photometric transformations

- **Saliency/ Matchability**

  Each feature has a distinctive description

- **Compactness and efficiency**

   Many fewer features than image pixels

- **Locality**

  A feature occupies a relatively small area of the
  image; robust to clutter and occlusion
