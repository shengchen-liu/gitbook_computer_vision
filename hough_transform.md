# Hough Transform

## Parametric Model

A parametric model can represent a class of instances where each is defined by a value of the parameters.

Examples include lines, or circles, or even a parameterized template.

## Fitting a parametric model

1. Choose a parametric model to represent a set of featuresã€‚

2. Membership criterion is not local:

   Cannot tell whether a point in the image belongs to a given model just by looking at that point

3. Computational complexity is important

   Not feasible to examine possible parameter setting
