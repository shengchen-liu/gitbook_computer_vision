# Blur

With a larger aperture, more light from each point hits the sensor.  This causes a blurring effect.

Controlling aperture vs. light quantity is a delicate balance.

If the aperture is too low, it is possible that not enough light will hit the sensor, resulting in a dark image; if the aperture is too high, it causes a blurry image.
