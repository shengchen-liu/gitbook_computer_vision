# Stereo Geometry

"Stereo": having two view of the same scene.  

**Why stereo?**

Structure and depth are inherently ambiguous from single views.  

## Stereo

- The image from one eye is a little different than the image from the other eye.
- Think of shape from "motion" between two views
- Infer 3d shape of scene from two imges from different viewpoints.

### Stereo photography and stereo viewers

Take two pictures of the same subject from two slightly different viewpoints and display so that each eye see only one of the images.
