# Motion

## 1. Video

A video is a sequence of frames captured over time $$I(x,y,t)$$

## 2. Motion Applications

### 2.1 Background Subtraction

Given a video with a relatively static scene and some moving objects, we can extract just the moving objects (or just the background).

### 2.2 Shot Boundary Detection

- Commercial video is usually composed of shots.
- Goal: segment video into shots for summarization and browsing.
- Difference from background subtraction: the camera is not necessarily stationary.

### 2.3 Motion Segmentation

Segment the video into multiple coherently moving objects.  Suppose we have many moving objects, we can segment out each of those objects individually and do some sort of independent analysis.
