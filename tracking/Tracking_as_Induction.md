# Tracking as Induction

## 1. Base Case

- Assume we have some initial prior that predicts state in the absence of any evidence: $$P(X_0)$$
- At the first frame, correct this, given value of $$Y_0 = y_0$$

## 2. Tracking as induction

Given corrected estimate for frame $$t$$:

- Predict for frame $$t+1$$
- Correct for frame $$t+1$$
