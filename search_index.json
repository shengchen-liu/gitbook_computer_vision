image?\nComputing Averages\nReplace the value of each pixel with the average value of the pixels around it.\nAssumptions\n\nThe \"true\" value of a pixel is probably similar to the \"true\" values of the nearby pixels.\nThe noise in each pixel is added independently.  Thus, the average of the noise around a pixel will be 0.\n\nWeighted moving average\nCloser pixels are more similar than further pixels.\nCorrelation Filtering with Uniform Weights\n\nG[i, j] = \\frac{1}{(2k + 1)^2} \\cdot \\sum_{u=-k}^k \\sum_{v=-k}^k F[i + u, j + v]\n\nCorrelation Filtering with non-uniform Weights\n\nG[i, j] = \\frac{1}{(2k + 1)^2} \\cdot \\sum_{u=-k}^k \\sum_{v=-k}^k H[u, v] F[i + u, j + v]\n\nwhere H[u, v] is the weight function.\nThis is also know as cross-correlation, denoted as G=H \\otimes F\nDrawbacks\nSquares aren't smooth\nBlurring Images\nGaussian Filter\n\nh(u, v) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^2}e^{-\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{\\sigma^2}}\n\nIn such a filter, the nearest neighboring pixels have the most influence.  Such weights are \"circularly symmetric\" which mathematically are said to be isotropic.\nGaussian Parameters\nThe only parameter is the variance \\sigma^2, which represents \"amount of smoothing\" that filter performs.\nModifying the size of kernel is not the same thing as modifying the variance.  The kernel has to be \"big enough\" to fairly represent the variance and let it perform a smoother blurring.\nMore Filter Examples\nSharpening Filter\nAccentuates the \"differences with the local average\", by comparing a more intense version of an image and its box blur\nMedian Filter\nAlso called an edge-preserving filter, this is actually a non-linear filter that is useful for other types of noise in an image.\n"},"basic_image_manipulation/Linearity and Convolution.html":{"url":"basic_image_manipulation/Linearity and Convolution.html","title":"Linearity and Convolution","keywords":"","body":"Linearity and Convolution\nLinearity\n\nAdditivity\nMultiplicative scaling\n\nShift Invariance\nAn operator behaves the same everywhere.

The main algorithms you will be using are the Kalman and Particle Filters.\nInstructions\n1. The Kalman Filter\nThe Kalman Filter (KF) is a method used to track linear dynamical systems with gaussian noise. Recall that both the predicted and the corrected states are gaussians, allowing us to keep the mean and covariance of the state in order to run this filter. Use the kalman filter on the provided images to track a moving circle.\nFirst we need to define the KF’s components. We will use the notation presented in the lectures for the N-dimensional case.\n1.1 State vector\nWe represent the filter’s state using the current position and velocities in the x, y plane. We will not use acceleration in our exercise.\n\nX= [x, y, v_x, v_y]\n\n1.2 Dynamics Model transition 4x4 matrix $D_t$\nThis matrix will map the equations below to the state components.

And the covariance is obtained from the squaring operation plus the process noise $Q$. We will also assume this noise is independent from each component in the state vector.\n$Xt^- = X{t-1}^+ D_t$\n$\\Sigmat^- = D_t \\Sigma{t-1}^+ D_t^T + Q$\n\nQ = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \\sigma_{d_x}^2 &0 &0 &0 \\\\ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  0 &\\sigma_{d_y}^2 &0 &0  \\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  0 & 0 & \\sigma_{d_{vx}}^2 & 0 \\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  0 & 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{d_{vy}}^2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \\end{array} \\right]\n\nBefore we continue to the Correction state.

It is an averaging factor that depends on uncertainty of state prediction and measurement updates.\n\nK_t = \\Sigma_t^- M_t^T(M_t \\Sigma_t^- M_t^T + \\Sigma_{m_t})^{-1}\n\n\n\\Sigma_{m_t} =\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \n\t\t\t\t\t\\sigma_{m_x}^2 & 0 \\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t0 & \\sigma_{m_y}^2\n \t\t\t\\end{array} \\right]\n\n1.6 State and Covariance Correction\n"}}}
