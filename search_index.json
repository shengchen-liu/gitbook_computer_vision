remove noise from an image?\nComputing Averages\nReplace the value of each pixel with the average value of the pixels around it.\nAssumptions\n\nThe \"true\" value of a pixel is probably similar to the \"true\" values of the nearby pixels.\nThe noise in each pixel is added independently.  Thus, the average of the noise around a pixel will be 0.\n\nWeighted moving average\nCloser pixels are more similar than further pixels.\nCorrelation Filtering with Uniform Weights\n\nG[i, j] = \\frac{1}{(2k + 1)^2} \\cdot \\sum_{u=-k}^k \\sum_{v=-k}^k F[i + u, j + v]\n\nCorrelation Filtering with non-uniform Weights\n\nG[i, j] = \\frac{1}{(2k + 1)^2} \\cdot \\sum_{u=-k}^k \\sum_{v=-k}^k H[u, v] F[i + u, j + v]\n\nwhere H[u, v] is the weight function.\nThis is also know as cross-correlation, denoted as G=H \\otimes F\nDrawbacks\nSquares aren't smooth\nBlurring Images\nGaussian Filter\n\nh(u, v) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^2}e^{-\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{\\sigma^2}}\n\nIn such a filter, the nearest neighboring pixels have the most influence.  Such weights are \"circularly symmetric\" which mathematically are said to be isotropic.\nGaussian Parameters\nThe only parameter is the variance \\sigma^2, which represents \"amount of smoothing\" that filter performs.\nModifying the size of kernel is not the same thing as modifying the variance.  The kernel has to be \"big enough\" to fairly represent the variance and let it perform a smoother blurring.\nMore Filter Examples\nSharpening Filter\nAccentuates the \"differences with the local average\", by comparing a more intense version of an image and its box blur\nMedian Filter\nAlso called an edge-preserving filter, this is actually a non-linear filter that is useful for other types of noise in an image.\n"},"basic_image_manipulation/Linearity and Convolution.html":{"url":"basic_image_manipulation/Linearity and Convolution.html","title":"Linearity and Convolution","keywords":"","body":"Linearity and Convolution\nLinearity\n\nAdditivity\nMultiplicative scaling\n\nShift Invariance\nAn operator behaves the same everywhere.

This is done by choosing two thresholds, low and high, and using the high threshold to start edge curves and the low one to continue them.\n\nNon-Maximal Suppression\nThis is a fancy term for what amounts to choosing the brightest (maximal) pixel of an edge and discarding the rest (suppression).  It works by looking in the gradient direction and keeping the maximal pixel.\nNon-maximal suppression is a general-purpose strategy towards filtering out lower-quality results and isn't restricted to edge detection applications.\nCanary Threshold Hysteresis\nAfter application of non-maximum suppression, remaining edge pixels  provide a more accurate representation of real edges in an image.  However, some edge pixels remain that are caused by noise and color  variation. In order to account for these spurious responses, it is  essential to filter out edge pixels with a weak gradient value and  preserve edge pixels with a high gradient value.  This is accomplished  by selecting high and low threshold values.  If an edge pixel’s gradient value is higher than the high threshold value, it is marked as a strong edge pixel. If an edge pixel’s gradient value is smaller than the high  threshold value and larger than the low threshold value, it is marked as a weak edge pixel. If an edge pixel's gradient value is smaller than  the low threshold value, it will be suppressed. The two threshold values are empirically determined and their definition will depend on the  content of a given input image.\nSo far, the strong edge pixels should certainly be involved in the final edge image, as they are extracted from the true edges in the image.  However, there will be some debate on the weak edge pixels, as these  pixels can either be extracted from the true edge, or the noise/color  variations. To achieve an accurate result, the weak edges caused by the  latter reasons should be removed. Usually a weak edge pixel caused from  true edges will be connected to a strong edge pixel while noise  responses are unconnected.  To track the edge connection, blob analysis is applied by looking at a weak edge pixel and its 8-connected  neighborhood pixels. As long as there is one strong edge pixel that is  involved in the blob, that weak edge point can be identified as one that should be preserved.\n2^{nd} Order Gaussian in 2D\nLaplacian operator:\n\n\\nabla ^2 f = \\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\nOnce you apply the Laplacian, the zero-crossings are the edges of the image.\n"},"hough_transform.html":{"url":"hough_transform.html","title":"Hough Transform","keywords":"","body":"Hough Transform\nParametric Model\nA parametric model can represent a class of instances where each is defined by a value of the parameters.\nExamples include lines, or circles, or even a parameterized template.\nFitting a parametric model\n\nChoose a parametric model to represent a set of features。\n\nMembership criterion is not local:\nCannot tell whether a point in the image belongs to a given model just by looking at that point\n\nComputational complexity is important\nNot feasible to examine possible parameter setting\n\n\n"},"hough transform/Line Fitting.html":{"url":"hough transform/Line Fitting.html","title":"Line Fitting","keywords":"","body":"Line Fitting\nDifficulty of Line Fitting\nClutter: There are a lot of resulting points and edges that clutter the image and don't necessarily represent lines.\nPartial Matches: Even with the clever hysteresis that extends and connects edges in the Canny Edge Operator, the edges that we find won't always represent the entire line represent in the original image.\nNoise: Even without the above imperfections, the resulting edges are noisy.

Hopefully, the lines that get many votes are valid.\nHough Space\nHough Space is also called parameter space - which enables a different representation of our desired shapes.\nThe key is that a line y = mx + b in image space represents a point in Hough space because we use the parameters of the line (m, b).  Similarly, a point in image space represents a line in Hough space.\nFor a given point (x_0, y_0), it fits all the lines going thought it with equation y_0 = mx_0 + b, thus it becomes b = -x_0m + y_0 which is a line in Hough space.\nMultiple Points\nIf we have two points, we can determine the line passing thought both of them in Cartesian space using:\n\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\nwhere as we know :\n\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\nSimilarly, a bunch of points produces a bunch of lines in Hough, all of which intersect in one place.  The closer the points are to a particular line of best fit, the closer their points of intersection in Hough space.\n\nIf we discretize Hough space into \"bins\" for voting, we end up with the Hough algorithm.  In the Hough algorithm, each point in image space votes for every bin along its line in Hough space: the bin with the most votes becomes the line of best fit among the points.\nUnfortunately, the (m,b) representation of lines comes with some problems.

This is implemented with a dynamic programming formulation.  This approach results in far better depth maps compared to the naive window matching method, but still results in streaking artifacts that are the result of the limitation of scanlines because they treat every scanline  without taking int account the vertical direction.\nGrid  Matching\nWhat defines a good stereo correspondence?\n\nMatch quality - Want each pixel to find a good appearance match in the other image\nSmoothness - of two pixels are adjacent, they should move about the same amount.\n\nStereo as energy minimization\nData term:\n\nE_{data} = \\sum_i (W_i (i) - W_2 (i + D(i))) ^2\n\nSmoothness term:\n\nE_{smooth} = \\sum_{neighbors i, j} \\rho(D(i) -D(j))\n\nTotal energy:\n\nE = \\alpha E_{data}(I_1, I_2, D) + \\beta E_{smooth}(D)\n\nChallenges\n\nLow-contrast ; textureless image regions\nOcclusions\nViolations of brightness constancy (e.g., specular reflections)\nReally large baselines (foreshortening and appearance change)\nCamera calibration errors\n\n"},"camera_and_images/Geometric Camera Calibration.html":{"url":"camera_and_images/Geometric Camera Calibration.html","title":"Geometric Camera Calibration","keywords":"","body":"Geometric Camera Calibration\nIn all the previous discussions we have the notion of a camera's coordinate system - an origin and an orientation.\nWe put the center of projection at this origin and the optic axis down the z axis.\nSo to do geometric reasoning about the world we need to relate the coordinate system of the world to that of the camera and the image.\nWe want to use the camera to tell us things about the world.
