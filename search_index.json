This is done by choosing two thresholds, low and high, and using the high threshold to start edge curves and the low one to continue them.\n\nNon-Maximal Suppression\nThis is a fancy term for what amounts to choosing the brightest (maximal) pixel of an edge and discarding the rest (suppression).  It works by looking in the gradient direction and keeping the maximal pixel.\nNon-maximal suppression is a general-purpose strategy towards filtering out lower-quality results and isn't restricted to edge detection applications.\nCanary Threshold Hysteresis\nAfter application of non-maximum suppression, remaining edge pixels  provide a more accurate representation of real edges in an image.  However, some edge pixels remain that are caused by noise and color  variation. In order to account for these spurious responses, it is  essential to filter out edge pixels with a weak gradient value and  preserve edge pixels with a high gradient value.  This is accomplished  by selecting high and low threshold values.  If an edge pixel’s gradient value is higher than the high threshold value, it is marked as a strong edge pixel. If an edge pixel’s gradient value is smaller than the high  threshold value and larger than the low threshold value, it is marked as a weak edge pixel. If an edge pixel's gradient value is smaller than  the low threshold value, it will be suppressed. The two threshold values are empirically determined and their definition will depend on the  content of a given input image.\nSo far, the strong edge pixels should certainly be involved in the final edge image, as they are extracted from the true edges in the image.  However, there will be some debate on the weak edge pixels, as these  pixels can either be extracted from the true edge, or the noise/color  variations. To achieve an accurate result, the weak edges caused by the  latter reasons should be removed. Usually a weak edge pixel caused from  true edges will be connected to a strong edge pixel while noise  responses are unconnected.  To track the edge connection, blob analysis is applied by looking at a weak edge pixel and its 8-connected  neighborhood pixels. As long as there is one strong edge pixel that is  involved in the blob, that weak edge point can be identified as one that should be preserved.\n2^{nd} Order Gaussian in 2D\nLaplacian operator:\n\n\\nabla ^2 f = \\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\nOnce you apply the Laplacian, the zero-corssings are the edges of the image.\n"},"hough_transform.html":{"url":"hough_transform.html","title":"Hough Transform","keywords":"","body":"Hough Transform\nParametric Model\nA parametric model can represent a class of instances where each is defined by a value of the parameters.\nExamples include lines, or circles, or even a parameterized template.\nFitting a parametric model\n\nChoose a parametric model to represent a set of features。\n\nMembership criterion is not local:\nCannot tell whether a point in the image belongs to a given model just by looking at that point\n\nComputational complexity is important\nNot feasible to examine possible parameter setting\n\n\n"},"hough transform/Line Fitting.html":{"url":"hough transform/Line Fitting.html","title":"Line Fitting","keywords":"","body":"Line Fitting\nDifficulty of Line Fitting\nClutter: There are a lot of resulting points and edges that clutter the image and don't necessarily represent lines.\nPartial Matches: Even with the clever hysteresis that extends and connects edges in the Canny Edge Operator, the edges that we find won't always represent the entire line represent in the original image.\nNoise: Even without the above imperfections, the resulting edges are noisy.

Hopefully, the lines that get many votes are valid.\nHough Space\nHough Space is also called parameter space - which enables a different representation of our desired shapes.\nThe key is that a line y = mx + b in image space represents a point in Hough space because we use the parameters of the line (m, b).  Similarly, a point in image space represents a line in Hough space.\nFor a given point (x_0, y_0), it fits all the lines going thought it with equation y_0 = mx_0 + b, thus it becomes b = -x_0m + y_0 which is a line in Hough space.\nMultiple Points\nIf we have two points, we can determine the line passing thought both of them in Cartesian space using:\n\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\nwhere as we know :\n\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\nSimilarly, a bunch of points produces a bunch of lines in Hough, all of which intersect in one place.  The closer the points are to a particular line of best fit, the closer their points of intersection in Hough space.\n\nIf we discretize Hough space into \"bins\" for voting, we end up with the Hough algorithm.  In the Hough algorithm, each point in image space votes for every bin along its line in Hough space: the bin with the most votes becomes the line of best fit among the points.\nUnfortunately, the (m,b) representation of lines comes with some problems.
